<p>An enduring principle of educational practice is learners learn in different ways and at different rates. Effective educators recognize the uniqueness of each individual learner. They understand each learner arrives at a new learning situation with different lived experiences, existing knowledge, cognitive processing strengths and weaknesses, learning preferences, values, and goals. At the same time, effective educators also recognize some aspects of the learning process are common to most, if not all, learners. For instance, most educators believe learning is an ongoing, reflective process. We tend to broadly believe human are constantly taking in new information, integrating it into what we already know, and developing ideas based on this merging of past and present. In the midst of educator’s diverse and sometimes contradictory ideas about learning, there seems to be a great deal of mystery, and countless myths about how the learning process actually works. Unit 4 will introduce some important questions about learning, such as:</p>
<p>❓ How can we as educators ensure our students are truly achieving the outcomes we intend?<br />
❓ What practises should educators use in order to create an effective learning environment?<br />
❓ What role do learners play in generating and sustaining this environment?<br />
❓ How can we maximize the likelihood of transformational learning?</p>

<p><img src="assets/u4/France_in_XXI_Century._School.jpg" alt="School in Y2K" />
<em>This image is in the Public Domain.</em></p>
<p>The image you see here was created in the early 20th century in France as a part of a series of images predicting what life would be like in 2000. You can see the full collection <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/france-in-the-year-2000-1899-1910/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p>As you can see, the artist envisioned a process whereby information was fed into a machine of some sort and just automagically downloaded into student minds. Kind of like this scene from the movie the <em>Matrix</em>:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6vMO3XmNXe4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>These are both examples of how the modern condition of thought (Unit 2), has shaped our thinking about learning. Many modern era educators viewed people as learning “machines” who could be “programmed” with instructions, just like we program computers. The legacy of this thinking still lingers and the educational model of instructors instructing students through instructions is still prevalent.</p>
<p>In these modern visions, learning is something done <em>to</em> students, not something done <em>by</em> students. The learner is completely passive in the process. The dreams of grade-schoolers to be able to rest a book on their head and learn by osmosis are just as far-fetched as the prognostications from the early 20th century, from the <em>Matrix,</em> and from the claims of many edtech companies today. However, we need to recognize that learning is hard work. Consider Erasmus’s (1965) comment in his dialogue <em>The Art of Learning</em>, “For my part, I know no other art of learning than hard work, devotion, and perseverance” (p. 461). This statement remains as true today, as it was in 1529.</p>
<p>Take a few minutes to watch this video from Destin Sandlin, creator of the YouTube channel <em>Smarter Every Day</em>. The video has a long introduction, but it is entertaining and sets up the problem of learning very well:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MFzDaBzBlL0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>Destin talks about some important ideas related to pedagogy (the study of how children learn) that are also applicable to andragogy (the study of how adults learn). One of those ideas is that <em>knowledge != understanding</em> (and now you know that the ‘!’ negates the ‘=’ in that statement). A little later in this unit, when we talk about deep and surface approaches to learning, we will come back to this idea.</p>
<div class="reflect">
<h4 id="reflect">
Reflect
</h4>
<p>
As a way to consolidate your own learning around this concept, take a
few minutes to think about a time when you have had knowledge, but not
understanding, and how that affected you in some way. You don’t have to
write anything down, just connect the idea to an experience that you
have had.
</p>
</div>
<p>In the video, Destin also talks about cognitive bias and the tremendously powerful effect that our own biases have on what and how well we learn. The challenge that he faced in learning to ride the backwards brain bike wasn’t so much the physical skills involved, but <em>unlearning</em> his previous ‘ride a bike’ algorithm. When he encountered new information that didn’t match his previous experience, it was extremely difficult to overcome his previous experience and bias. It took him 8 months of dedicated effort to do it. At the end, he discovered that he hadn’t <em>overcome</em> his bias, he had only transferred it to a new bias, albeit one that was easier to overcome.</p>
<p>This process is also true for people learning new ideas. None of us come to a learning context without preconceived ideas regarding the nature of the topic to be studied, and often, those ideas are incorrect. They are misconceptions. Biases. Then, when new information comes along, our brain actively sabotages us by telling us that we already know this and we don’t need to listen, while simultaneously convincing us even more of the truth of our misconceptions.</p>
<p>Below is another video, this time from <em>Veritasium,</em> in which Derek Muller shows why misconceptions (biases) can be so difficult to overcome:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eVtCO84MDj8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>Despite the difficulty, it is important to note that we <em>can</em> overcome these biases and misconceptions. In fact, we can overcome some bizarre inputs, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/nov/12/improbable-research-seeing-upside-down">researchers have discovered and was briefly reported in The Guardian</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a slightly less scientifically rigorous portrayal of what happens when our vision is artificially flipped: (The video is 12 minutes, but you don’t need to watch it all).</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OJTC_E2Nlgg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>The point of these experiments, at least for our purposes, is that human brains (and likely other animals as well) demonstrate the characteristic of <em>plasticity</em>. The connections in our brain that allow ideas to form and be adjusted can be broken and then reconnected in different configurations.</p>
<p><strong><em>This is learning. Learning is hard work.</em></strong></p>
<p>One implication of this is that it is naïve for educators to assume that a single exposure to an idea will somehow cause learning. In fact, the opposite is true. It takes repeated exposure, practice, error-correction, and adjustment for learning to become consolidated.</p>

<h2>Topic 2<a href="coaching-for-learning.html#topic-2-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><strong><em>What is Coaching?</em></strong> Coaching is something that you do to help improve someone in some way. Gallway (1997) defines coaching as “a way of being, listening, asking, and speaking that draws out and augments characteristics and potential that are already present in a person.” His conceptualization of the method is analogous to Michelangelo’s approach to sculpture. Michelangelo believed that “every block of stone has a statue inside it and it’s the task of the sculptor to discover it.” Similarly, Gallway (1997) writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Coaches know that an oak tree already exists within an acorn. They have seen the one grow into the other, over time and under the right conditions, and are committed to providing those conditions to the best of their abilities. Successful coaches continually learn how best to “farm” the potential they are given to nurture.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>How do Educators Coach Learners for Learning?</em></strong> The beginning point of an effective coaching for learning practice as an educator is the coaching relationship. It’s critical, according to Gallway (1997), for coaches to “[create] a safe and challenging environment in which learning can take place.” In the educator’s role as coach, this relationship is a shared learning space where the educator enters the learners’ internal dialogue with their learning experiences. Coaching work involves two aims,</p>
<ul>
<li>helping each learner become aware of their own potential, and,<br />
</li>
<li>helping learners remove any interference in realizing this potential.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of coaching for learning we know that it is a natural aspect of our nature as human beings to learn. That is, it’s something we simply do naturally. But, one thing that makes learning difficult is that our past learning gradually starts to interfere with our present and future learning.</p>
<p>Increasing learners’ awareness of their own internal resistance to new learning is the primary theme of coaching for learning. Common obstacles to learning, according to Gallway (1997), include the learner’s assumption that they already know what is being taught, the fear of being judged, doubt, and trying too hard to appear learned. In broader terms, Scharmer (2016) has identified the learners’ internal <strong><em>voice of judgement</em></strong> (VoJ), <strong><em>voice of cynicism</em></strong> (VoC), and <strong><em>voice of fear</em></strong> (VoF) as universal factors interfering with learning. The role of effective coaching is to help learners overcome these obstacles by opening their mind, emotions, and will to new possibilities. This work involves coaching learners through the transition of change—that is,
- letting go of what was,
- moving through the transition, and
- embracing a new beginning.</p>
<p>The secondary theme of coaching for learning is increasing learners’ awareness of how they may best realize their potential capacity to learn anything which they set out to learn. This involves coaching learners in the learning process and helping them make it more effective and efficient. This practice builds on the notion of transforming the learners’ natural learning process into a disciplined set of study skills. A helpful approach that educators can use to coach for learning potential is the GROW coaching model. This model is based on the coaching concepts pioneered by Gallway (1997) and developed at the McKinsey consulting firm in the 1980s and first published in 1992 by John Whitmore in his book <em>Coaching for Performance</em>. The model is widely used in leadership and life coaching contexts. For educators concerned with coaching for learning, we can apply this model in the following way:</p>
<div class="bonus">
<p>
<strong>Goal Setting.</strong> Helping learners clarify
<strong>what</strong> they need and more importantly want to learn?
<strong>Why</strong> they need and/or truly want to learn it? And
<strong>when</strong> they need to, or genuinely want, to learn it? The
coach, here, also helps learners see how their personal goals can align
with prescribed learning outcomes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Reality Checking.</strong> Helping learners identify what
they already know? What they can already do? What they have already
done? What’s moving them towards their goal? And what’s getting in the
way?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Option Exploring.</strong> Helping learners identify the
various options they have to move them toward their goals. Brainstorming
what else they can do to achieve their goals? Assessing what are the
benefits and weaknesses of the various options that they have
identified?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Will be Doing.</strong> Helping learners choose which options
to act on. Determining when to act on an option. Assessing how committed
they are to taking action a given option? Committing to acting on an
option.

<h2>Topic 3<a href="coaching-for-learning.html#topic-3-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Effective coaching is grounded in an emerging set of coaching competencies. These competencies represent a set of integrated knowledge, skills, aptitudes and attributes that coalesce into behaviors that define, in more detail, what is needed to successfully perform the task of helping learners learn. The following are six essential behaviors the developing educator as coach must demonstrate.</p>
<div id="practicing-professional-ethics-standards" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3><strong>Practicing Professional Ethics &amp; Standards</strong><a href="coaching-for-learning.html#practicing-professional-ethics-standards" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The basis of this competency is a personal commitment to demonstrating and maintaining the highest level of ethical behavior. Emerging professional coaching standards include,<br />
✅ making the roles, responsibilities, and rights of everyone involved in the coaching relationship clear,<br />
✅ clearly communicating how information will be communicated between everyone involved in the coaching relationship,<br />
✅ maintain confidentiality of personal information and communications,<br />
✅ having a clear understanding of the conditions where information will not be kept confidential, and<br />
✅ be aware of and respond sensitively to potential power or status differences.</p>

<h3>Cultivating Trust &amp; Safety<a href="coaching-for-learning.html#cultivating-trust-safety" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Seeks to understand the learner and their unique learning context, demonstrates respect for the learner’s identity, values and perspective, showing empathy and concern for their well-being, acknowledges the learner unique abilities, interests, and feelings, demonstrating openness and vulnerability, and supporting the unique needs of the learner’s personality.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="holding-spacepresence" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Holding Space/Presence<a href="coaching-for-learning.html#holding-spacepresence" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Being focused on the moment and giving attention to what is occurring in your conversation with the learner. Initially, this might feel like simply holding yourself back from talking too much as the coach and giving the learner space (that is, your silence) to reflect and process things. One way to conceptualize this competency as “creating a “space to listen into.” This involves<br />
✅ creating comfortable distance in physical space,<br />
✅ creating a non-judgmental emotional space, and<br />
✅ creating a quiet auditory space. Holding space, or being present, is an essential way the educator as coach can demonstrate to the learner that the learner’s contribution is valued and their learning is important. It’s also important for the coach to hold space for themselves to reflect and process what is happening.</p>
