This will start with you posting to a Moodle Discussion forum, and then transition to your blog (to be introduced in Unit 3). You should consider your posts as a place for you to try out new ideas, to test your assumptions, and to share what you are learning with your community. At the end of the course you will produce a Showcase Post, which will represent your best work. The showcase post will be the only graded post; however, your final grade will also consider how your ideas developed over the process of you writing five working draft posts. Each of your draft posts should be 400-500 words. Post 1 Due at the end of Unit 1 Topic In a new post, complete the Visitors and Residents in online spaces Learning Activity.

Post 5 Due at the end of Unit 5 Topic Throughout this unit we have explore the idea of the educational experience. Your task for the Unit 5 Blog Post, is to reflect on recent trends in higher, and other forms, of adult education in terms of the multitude of new ways institutions are offering access educational experiences. You can use the following questions to guide your writing: How can educational institutions give learners more control over their learning experiences? What benefits and challenges does learner-centred access to education introduce? Is the recent move towards multi-access education shifting the site of education back to an emphasis on study and away from the focus on instruction that dominated the modern era? How might this shift change the educator’s role and responsibilities? How might this shift change the learner’s role and responsibilities change? How can institutions ensure quality and transformational learning outcomes? Showcase Post Due at the end of the course Topic Choose one of the previous 5 posts that you would like to showcase as your best work. Take some time to polish and expand your post (aim for 600-700 words). Ways to expand your post might include: - finding more published research about the topic to integrate into your post; - writing about how your views have changed on the topic during the course; - writing a counter-argument refuting your previous post. Please include citations (links) and a reference list at the end of your post. To submit this discussion post, create a new post on your own WordPress blog and use the categories ‘ldrs663’ and ‘showcase’. Small Group Facilitation (10%) Working in a learning pod you will each choose, prepare, and facilitate one 15 to 20 minute long small group discussion that is based on one of the units/topics from LDRS 663. You will record a video of your session (likely in Zoom). Following the facilitation, your group will engage in a 10-15 minute debrief about your facilitation. You may choose to structure the debrief following the What, So What, Now What? W³ from the Learning Activity in Unit 3, Topic 6. Finally, you will write a 300-500 word critical reflection on your actions as the learning facilitator, including the debrief. Your reflection should be submitted as a post on your blog with the category ldrs663. In your facilitation session, demonstrate and reflect on the following: First, preparing for the session (as evidenced by your composed materials to support learning in your session). Second, creating a supportive environment (referring to participants by name, clarifying expectations, responding in an affirming way to others, and acting in and communicating in a respectful and supportive manner). Third, managing the learning process (beginning and ending the session on time, fostering participation by all learners in the group, keeping the learning group on track, facilitating interaction within the learning group, and summarizing learning, calmly and creatively adapting to unexpected events). Fourth, fostering learning (showing interest and enthusiasm, spending more time asking than telling, posing open-ended questions, waiting for learners to respond, seeking clarification, activating learners’ prior knowledge effectively, using appropriate forms of engagement to stimulate learner involvement). Facilitated Curriculum Analysis (10%) Working together as a learning pod, examine a curricular resource that is, or could be, used with a facilitated learning approach. Emphasis will be placed on courses in higher education, including a selection of TWU’s library of FAR courses (specifically designed to be delivered in a facilitated learning approach). However, a range of other formats are open for investigation, including (but not limited to) community-based programs, professional certification programs, corporate workshops or training programs, and masterclasses. Your pod will be invited to select a specific course of study and asked to assess the curriculum from a facilitation and coaching perspective. To begin, follow the steps below: Step 1 Review the course materials you have been assigned or received approve to analyze. Step 2 Write a Summary of Understanding. In this second step you will critically reflect on the course materials and write a 3-page summary of understanding from your perspective as a future learning facilitator who is preparing to facilitate this course. In your summary you will compose in your own words your thought on the following: Who is the course for? Describe the target learners to whom the course will be offered. The instructors and/or your sponsor organization will provide you with this information. But, you should also add some of your own research. How has COVID-19 impacted the learners in the course? Learners and faculty alike have been deeply impacted by coronavirus and COVID-19. How has that impacted learners in the course? Are they quarantined? Do they have access to technology at home? A quiet place to study? Are they looking after their children during the course? What is the course about? Consider the course title, description, course learning outcomes, unit and topic titles, and in your own words try to summarize how you would explain to someone what this course of study is about? What do learners need to know? Looking for patterns in the course materials and try to identify what you think are the three to five big ideas that the learners are expected to learn in this course? What do learners need to do? Look at the learning activities and assessments to identify the performance-based tasks learners need to do. Specifically, focus on the tasks like forum posts and papers the learners need to produce something. How do the learners complete the course? Determine if there is a critical path of task throughout the course. That is, are certain tasks contingent on one task being completed for another one can be done? Or is the path open-ended? What challenges do you anticipate? Identify the specific challenges that you think learners may face as they work through this particular course of study. Do parts of the course look particularly difficult? Are any resources missing, or underdeveloped, or potentially difficult for certain cultural contexts to understand? What supports do you need to prepare? Identify the specific types of support you anticipate will be critical to helping learners successfully complete the learning outcomes of the course you are analyzing. What questions do you have? If you could ask the course designer clarifying questions about the course, what would you want to know? What is unclear? What don’t you understand? What are you curious to know more about? Grading Rubric for Curriculum Facilitation Analysis Emerging (0-69%) No/Minimal demonstration of independent thought, insight, and creativity (applies course concepts, raises questions, recognises competing perspectives, and evaluates implications) No/minimal evidence of having reviewed all readings and a lack of comprehensiveness in responses to questions. No/Minimal demonstration of ability to communicate ideas in writing and to organize responses clearly, thoroughly, and concisely. Developing (70-89%) Sufficient demonstration of independent thought, insight, and creativity (applies course concepts, raises questions, recognises competing perspectives, and evaluates implications) Evidence of having reviewed all readings (course related and the curriculum resources being assessed) and a comprehensiveness in responses to questions. Demonstrates ability to communicate ideas in writing and to organize responses clearly, thoroughly, and concisely. Mastering (90-100%) Clearly demonstrates independent thought, insight, and creativity (applies course concepts, raises questions, recognises competing perspectives, and evaluates implications) Presence of examples and evidence of understanding of content create a comprehensive response that is accurate and thorough. Organization and use of language is concise and clearly articulates ideas with no confusion. To submit this assignment, scroll to the bottom of the screen on the Unit 5 Tab and select the “Unit 5 - Curriculum Facilitation Analysis Assignment” dropbox. Facilitation Resource Project (40%) Working as a learning pod, you will create a guide to serve as a resource for you and others to facilitate a particular course of study. We can’t emphasize enough how important it will be for you to have analyzed, critiqued, and integrated into your practice the model of coaching and facilitation in real-world settings. As you may be facilitating learning experiences in subjects where you may not have significant domain knowledge, it will be critical for you to be able to lead students through thinking and learning processes that will lead to them discovering what they need to know from the expertly prepared course materials in order to help solve their questions. Learning Pods At the beginning of the course everyone will be placed into small groups called learning pods. these groups, of about four people, will be the place where you will practice learning facilitation and coaching principles and skills that you are learning in this course. The pods will also form the working group for doing a curriculum analysis and developing a facilitated learning resource. Peer Coaching Session (15%) Working with another student (in your pod), you will each coach each other through the process of writing your final “showcase” post as part of your learning reflection blog assignment. You will record a video of your session and write critical reflection on your actions as the learning coach. "],["building-the-web.html", "Unit 1 Building the Web Overview Topics Outcomes Resources 1.1 Visitors and Residents 1.2 FIPPA, Privacy, and Consent Resources 1.3 WordPress and Privacy 1.4 WordPress Setup 1.5 WordPress Tutorials", " Unit 1 Building the Web Overview Over the first two weeks, we will introduce you to some background thinking about educational technologies. There are countless companies vying for attention in the edtech field, and they are not all educationally beneficial. In fact, some are outright harmful. We believe that it is important for you to begin to think about how your data are used when you interact with edtech tools and that it is important for you to develop some skills and competencies in building your own domain on the web. With this knowledge, you will be more prepared to spot the nefarious actors and to take control of how you present yourself online. Topics Situating yourself online Data and Privacy Subverting surveilance capitalism Outcomes you will be able to articulate the importance of data and your privacy rights you will have gained confidence in presenting your whole self online you will be able to create and manage a single WordPress blog. Resources Online resources will be provided. 1.1 Visitors and Residents It is likely that you have encountered and may believe that there is a distinction between digital ‘natives’ and ‘immigrants’. Note Marc Prensky, who proposed this idea, is the one who thought it would be a good idea to refer to people as ‘natives’. We recognize that this term should not be used to talk about people. The essential argument is that kids these days have changed in that they have this innate ability to use and learn technology because they have grown up using technology, and those of us whose formative years pre-date the advent of the internet are forever at a disadvantage compared to the kids. You can read a bit more about the idea on Wikipedia, linked below. There is also a link in that article to Prensky’s original article. Digital native Aside from the problematic framing of learners as kids, there are some distinct challenges with the idea of digital literacy being a fixed trait rather than a matter of comfort, familiarity, and a skill that can be practiced and learned. It is no secret that more young people are comfortable using social media apps like TikTok, Instagram, SnapChat, Weibo, WeChat, and the like, but that does not mean that those people are more able to learn technology than older people or that they have an innate ability to do so. Have you ever asked a 1st-year university student to use a spreadsheet to create a budget or a gradebook with embedded formulae? It is more likely than not, that you will encounter a distinct lack of skill in completing this task. I’d like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a visitor in some web spaces and a resident in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you, quite literally, visit, but importantly, don’t leave a public trace of your time there. You don’t spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving. Alternately, there are places and spaces on the web, where you reside as a persona, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or Twitter, or maybe it’s a listserv you subscribed to back in the 90s, or your blog, or someone else’s blog or social site. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people; where you are socially present. At the same time, if we can imagine the visitor &lt;–&gt; resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal &lt;–&gt; professional (or educational) continuum on a vertical axis, leading to 4 quadrants where you might situate your technology use. The video below explains a process to help you think about where you reside on the web (7 mins). Link to YouTube I’ve shared my VR Diagram below…keep in mind that this diagram represents a set of tools that I have been using for a decade or more and that I have invested my career in educational technology. There is a lot here, but yours might look significantly different with only a few tools here and there. The main thing I would like to communicate with this idea of visitors and residents is for you to think about which technologies you use as a resident, and then to think about where your learners reside on the web. From there, we can begin to plan for tools we can use that afford us and our learners the opportunity to reside there. Visitor-Resident Diagram It is certainly notable that I am very much a visitor in Moodle! This does not mean that I don’t spend much time there, I spend a significant portion of every day working in Moodle, rather, the work that I do there leaves very little trace of my personality. You will (hopefully) see Moodle as much more of a place where you reside. But this foregrounds the question of whether Moodle is actually designed to promote residencies. Certainly the forums allow for users to project their persona into the system, as do a few of the other features, but the system itself is very heavily templated. There are profiles that can be edited, but users are limited to one very tiny image and virtually no opportunity to determine for themselves what they want to share. There is little room for customization, and every time a course ends, every single user must recreate their persona in a new course site (or five). For many, or most, of you, Moodle is a perfectly reasonable place to reside and you are able to make learners feel at home there. We encourage that. And just like our physical homes, the quality of the community that lives there isn’t determined by the features of the house itself, but by the people who share the space and how they structure their time and interactions. If you don’t already, I encourage you to subscribe to this excellent podcast called Teaching in Higher Ed by Bonni Stachowiak, or, just take 47 minutes to listen to this episode in which Bonni interviews Dave White about the idea of visitors and residents. Digital Visitors and Residents, with David White - Teaching in Higher Ed One of the people I look up to as an educator published a blog post which I believe provides a fitting summary of this particular unit. Technology is not Pedagogy Learning Activity Visitor and Resident Diagram I hope this activity will help you think about how the tools we use shape and sometimes determine the nature of our interactions with learners. Do the tools you use fall on the visitor or the resident end of your continuum? What about the learners in your classes? ✔️ Read Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement ✔️ Complete your own Visitor/Resident map and share and discuss it with your Learning Pod. You can use the tool that is provided here (DON’T forget to screenshot it, or you’ll lose it!), or use a different tool like Canva.com. ✔️ Share your Visitor-Resident Diagram in a new post on your WordPress blog. Include a short reflection on what your diagram tells you about your web presence. Feel free to interact with others’ diagrams! 1.2 FIPPA, Privacy, and Consent Resources It is second nature to most to take selfies and share them on Instagram, Snapchat, etc., but once you move into the role of an educator in either a public or private context, you must adhere to the laws set out by the B.C. Office of Information and Privacy Commissioner. Their office has put together guidelines for both public bodies and private bodies. TWU, as a private body is not held to the same standard as public bodies, but we should strive to meet the same standard. The guidelines for public bodies to better understand what the rules are is linked below and how to get consent is detailed on page 4 of the BC Cloud Computing Guidelines (PDF) and you can review the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act here.. TWU also has a privacy policy, available here. Each public body will have their own process (which may range from not allowing tools to pressure to integrate networked learning tools from outside of Canada), so it is important to understand your own setting and the law. You may find some administrators or staff breaking these rules or not aware of them. It is important for you to enter your field and uphold the law, regardless of the culture you enter. This does not mean that you do not engage online or outside of Canada. It means that if/when you do so, that you understand the steps, which are not much more complex than the consent you would get normally for going “on the Internet,” as is described in most settings, but you must name the date consent is effective and, if applicable, the date it expires. It is important that you work with your school district on the consent process. You can see an example of how K-12 school districts are addressing access to cloud tools outside of Canada here (Coquitlam) and here plus here (Victoria). You must also name each tool individually. It cannot be “blogging.” You must name WordPress.com or Blogger, etc. If you use Flipgrid, you must name Flipgrid. Consent must also be informed, so effort must be taken to ensure that those signing consent understand the implications – that their data may leave Canada, how it may be harvested, and to know about the U.S. Patriot Act. One archived resource by the Canadian Treasury Board provides significant detailed information about the Patriot Act here. It is helpful to also review section 4(b) of the B.C. Digital Literacy Framework which is applicable K12 contexts but helpful for others. Additional resources can be found here: Privacy, Ethics &amp; Security in Digital Spaces Developing Awareness of Privacy Information Security Awareness by the BC Government MediaSmarts: Canada’s Centre for Digital and Media Literacy FIPPA, Privacy, and Consent Competencies Learners should ensure that they: - Are aware of the OIPC, FIPPA, and the Cloud Computing Guidelines and follow them - Understand what constitutes personal information - Understand that privacy online is a personal choice and must be respected - Understand that when you assume an “educator” hat, you have a duty for those under your care, their parents and families, and your colleagues with regard to their privacy and protection of personal information - Are aware that the Canadian federal government states that the chances are remote that the US Patriot Act will access personal information of Canadians, but recognizes that it is our responsibility to protect privacy preferences and to ensure that consent obtained is informed consent. Some families may be involved with restraining orders and need to be private for their safety, but the reasons for privacy may be preference. Either way, it is not our business as to the reasons for privacy preferences, but it is our responsibility to uphold preferences. - Understand how media moves through networks into US cloud-based services (e.g., back-ups on iTunes, syncing with Dropbox, messages with personal information is sent on Gmail, Google Docs, blog RSS subscriptions, etc.) - Understand that these acts do not prohibit participation in networked tools outside of Canada and many public bodies are in need of staff and leaders who model networked literacy and positive citizenship online for their community - Understand what appropriate consent looks like for public bodies and is aware of what alternative steps are to support learners when consent is not obtained. 1.3 WordPress and Privacy Now that you have thought about privacy in our digital world, it is time for you to make some decisions about how you would like to ‘be’ online. You are invited to document your learning in WordPress. This means that your work would be posted online on a public site. Keep in mind, though, that you are NOT required to post your work publicly. The steps below can help you decide how comfortable you are with sharing publicly. Please review all 5 steps below to decide on your approach. Decide if you are comfortable posting your work online. If not, you can document your learning offline (with technology) by changing the privacy settings on your blog or using Word documents and offline video. We would ask learners to consider using an online blogging tool with no identification/using a pseudonym, so as to develop network literacy, which is important in supporting learners, who are growing up in networked environments, but the preferences of learners will be respected and supported. If you are comfortable being online, then proceed to step 2. Would you like to use your real name or use a pseudonym? You can claim your name online and own your presence by using your full name. With increasing catfishing and identity theft online, it can be helpful to have a presence that may compete with any fake profiles of you that are out there or to have a more dominant presence so posts or pictures of you by others may get drowned out. That said, you may wish to create an identity without your personal information (e.g., West coast teacher). The choice is yours. With that decision made, proceed to step 3. Decide if you would like your blog to be hosted outside of Canada or inside of Canada. We strongly recommend that you create a blog at create.twu.ca which is built specifically for students and faculty at TWU, is hosted within Canada, and is completely free for you to use. We also have created a template for you there, which will make getting started easier. You will not lose access to your site at create.twu.ca after you finish at TWU, but you are free to export it and publish it on your own space and on your own domain (e.g., http://yourname.ca or http://westcoastteacher.ca) with a web hosting company for a reasonable annual fee. Some of these companies host outside of Canada (e.g., Dreamhost), while others host within Canada (e.g., Canadian Web Hosting). Be sure you review the resources under the privacy tutorial on this site or talk to your instructor about the implications of your options. You should also review the resources at the BC Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner along with the Cloud Computing Guidelines, which outline how to get consent. With that decision made, proceed to step 4. You also have to decide if you want to make your blog public or private. You can set an entire blog to be private or simply selected posts can be set to private. You can set a password or invite people to gain access. We have provided instructions for adjusting your privacy settings on the tutorial page for opened.ca. ✨ ProTip If you choose to make your blog private, we will not be able to syndicate your posts to the course site. You will still be able to participate in the course, but please contact your instructor if you choose to make your site only visible to registered users of the network or your site. And last, but not least… Finally, you have to think about where you and your content will end up. The wonderful thing about WordPress is that you can import that exported file into another WordPress instance (it sounds hard, but it isn’t and we’ll show you) or if you want to later set up your own domain and with your own WordPress installation. You may also import it into WordPress.com, but be aware that if you made posts with personal information knowing your site was hosted in Canada at the time and simply contained regular consent, without the specific consent for hosting outside of Canada, which requires you to name each tool, etc., you might not have consent to switch to WordPress.com. We often advise learners to post as if they will be on the cloud outside of Canada. To be honest, if you have a public blog, your friends and colleagues may be using U.S. cloud-hosted tools like Feedly to curate and read your blog posts or they may repost/quote your content on their U.S. blog. There are many educators who use U.S. software in their teaching and to support their learners. Just be sure to review how to get consent as per page four of the BC OIPC Cloud Computing Guidelines linked here. Creating a Blog Once you have done all the reflections on these 5 steps, you can move forward with creating a blog. Please visitcreate.twu.ca, click the blue ‘Log in’ link and follow the instructions.

Please complete these tasks by Friday, April 8 @ 11:00 PM PDT Overview Welcome to LDRS 663 - Coaching for Transformational Blended Learning! In this second unit, we will begin by considering the nature of learning communities through the lens of a model called the Community of Inquiry (CoI) (Garrison et al., 2000; Vaughan et al., 2013). The CoI model proposes that there are three overlapping components, or presences, to any learning environment; cognitive presence (constructing meaning), social presence (projecting a sense of yourself), and teaching presence (designing and facilitating the learning experience). The CoI model is grounded in a long history of social constructivism which is the idea that learning is fundamentally a social process (Dewey, 1897; Vygotsky, 1978). We will also consider various modes of interaction in learning environments and how these two models have informed the model of teaching and learning in TWU FAR Centres. Topics This unit is divided into 3 topics: Introduction to the Community of Inquiry Model Modes of Interaction Interaction Equivalency Theorem Learning Outcomes When you have completed this unit you should be able to: Analyze the characteristics of the Community of Inquiry model. Evaluate different modes of interaction. Criticize the Interaction Equivalency Theorem. Resources Here are the resources you will need to complete this unit: Critical inquiry in a text-based environment: Computer conferencing in higher education Getting the mix right again: An updated and theoretical rationale for interaction Interaction and the online distance classroom: Do instructional methods effect the quality of interaction? ✨ ProTip Ok…it would seem that the TWU library has lost access to the database that contains the Kanuka article above (‘Interaction and the online distance classroom…’). Here is how I go about tracking down articles In this case, I’ve completed all of the checked items and am waiting to hear back from Dr. Kanuka): ✅ I see if I have access through another library. As a PhD candidate at UVic, I have access to their library, and it turns out that this article is in their collection, but that doesn’t help you. ✅ I use a Firefox extension called ‘Unpaywall’, which searches for open-access versions of the same article as researchers are often able to post pre-print versions of their article on their own site. In this case, unpaywall just links to the PDF that I have access to through UVic. ✅ I contact the TWU library for assistance, as librarians are among the most helpful people on the planet. In this case, I was provided an open link, but that link looks fishy as it isn’t apparently tied to Kanuka’s site, but rather an aggregation site. Often, I also request an inter-library loan, in which the TWU library would contact another library (maybe UVic) and request a copy through them. ✅ Search Google Scholar as that will often pick up on preprints on the author’s website. ✅ Search ResearchGate for preprints. ✅ Contact the author of the paper. They often have permission to share preprints (see above) and are usually happy to share their work, especially with grad students. ❌ Here is where we start getting into academic grey areas…so don’t do this. It is against publishers policy to use tools like the hashtag #ICanHazPDF on Twitter, where you post the title of the article you are looking for under that hashtag and another researcher might respond by DM’ing you a copy. You shouldn’t do this, because it cuts into the absurd profits of massive multi-national corporations who benefit from the free work of researchers all over the world. This is nothing like walking down a hallway and knocking on your colleague’s door to ask if they have a copy of a paper, because that is super illegal too and this is digital…or something. And this whole mess of strategies could be avoided if everyone published under an open license and the research that is created, usually with government funding, was freely available to those who need it. An update on this link… ✅ I received a response from the author, who generously provided a PDF copy of the article. This is very common. ✅ Also, I discovered at the bottom of the page when I viewed the article signed into a different library, that there was an option to get a sharing link, so I copied that link and updated the URL above. This seems to provide a read-only link for people who don’t have access through a library or other institution.

Athabasca: AU Press. - This book is available for free at AUPress. 2.1 Introduction to the Community of Inquiry Model Before you dive into the content of this unit in LDRS 663, take a moment to recall some particularly memorable learning experiences that you have had. They don’t have to be particularly profound in terms of what you learned, but profound because of the fact that you still remember that you learned something and how you learned it. Pick one or two of those experiences and be prepared share them in our class meeting. Make sure to tell us about the context of your experience. Who was there? What did you do to learn? Why do you remember it? Social Constructivism There is a very good chance that your recollection of a memorable learning experience as part of the previous learning activity included a description of some sort of social interaction. This isn’t always the case, but the idea that learning is a social process has a long history in education. Many theorists credit John Dewey for bringing this idea to the forefront of educators’ minds. In his 1897 treatise My Pedagogic Creed he writes: I believe that the school is primarily a social institution. Education being a social process, the school is simply that form of community life in which all those agencies are concentrated that will be most effective in bringing the child to share in the inherited resources of the race, and to use his own powers for social ends. (p. 7) The idea didn’t originate with Dewey, though, as we know that in first-century Palestine there was a certain itinerant teacher whose lessons were profoundly impactful on a small group of young men and women who were called to live and learn in a deeply personal and social community. Following Dewey, many others, such as Jean Piaget, Jerome Bruner, and Lev Vygotsky (see Driscoll, 2005) have written about what has now become known as the educational theory of social constructivism, or, more concisely, constructivism. Driscoll (2005) describes constructivism as a theory that &gt; rests on the assumption that knowledge is constructed by learners as they attempt to make sense of their experiences. Learners, therefore are not empty vessels waiting to be filled, but rather active organisms seeking meaning. (p.387) This process of seeking meaning is an iterative process whereby the learner experiences some sort of cognitive dissonance, or a disconnect between what they previously knew and some new piece of evidence or experience that disconfirms that knowledge. The learner then seeks to resolve that dissonance by either incorporating the new experience into an older schema, or by disregarding one or the other. Most often, the resulting knowledge is constructed from portions of both the new and old idea. Community of Inquiry This brings us to the idea of a ‘Community of Inquiry’ (CoI), which was first described by Garrison, Anderson, and Archer in their 2000 article “Critical Inquiry in a text-based environment”. Garrison, et al. theorize that there are three critical components, or “presences” that compose an interactive, online learning environment: Cognitive presence, social presence, and teaching presence. The intersection of these three presences is the heart of an educational experience. Community of Inquiry Model (Garrison, et al., (2000) Cognitive Presence Cognitive presence, possibly the most foundational element, is the &gt; extent to which the participants in any particular configuration of a community of inquiry are able to construct meaning through sustained communication (p. 89). Recall that this cognitive process is at the heart of constructivist learning environments. It seems obvious (be careful when people say that) that this construction of meaning through communication is the entire point of higher education. Your task as a student is to change your own mind, and that is a very tall order as our beliefs about many things are remarkably resilient. The way we engage in this task will have a significant bearing on the outcomes of the task. If we approach communication with too much confidence in our own views, we can shut out competing ideas to our own detriment, so it is important to bring a cautious intelligence, or, as I once heard a student describe it, epistemic humility. We all know that we are wrong about some things. The trouble is we don’t know what we are wrong about and how we have misunderstood. Cognitive presence in a text-based environment (like an online course) carries with it some affordances, but also some disadvantages. It is a relatively common experience for people to type something in a text message or an email, only to have their intentions grossly misunderstood because there are fewer para-linguistic cues in text compared to verbal face-to-face communication. Recent developments in incorporating emojis have started to change this, but emojis are generally considered to be too informal for ‘serious scholarly work’ or written professional communication. So, the relatively lean environment of text can lead to significant misunderstandings. On the other hand, for learners like me who tend toward introversion, the asynchronous nature of text-based learning environments is a huge advantage. I couldn’t count the number of times that I have wanted to contribute to an in-class discussion, but needed too much time to formulate a coherent response, and before I knew it, the conversation had moved on. My point was no longer relevant, having been resolved by those in the class who were more extroverted and ready with an answer. A text-based environment, however, gives me time to think, write, revise, and then post my response. Social Presence Garrison, et.al. describe social presence as &gt;the ability of participants in the Community of Inquiry to project their personal characteristics into the community, thereby presenting themselves to the other participants as “real people.” (p. 89) In any community, and especially the TWU community, the ability to belong and to be accepted as a whole and integrated person is critical to people feeling like they actually do belong. It is for this reason that many experienced online educators encourage a more colloquial style of writing in online forums or blogs. Strict adherence to APA or other style guides virtually eliminates self-referential language such as personal pronouns. It is hard to project your personal characteristics as a real person when you can only refer to yourself in the third person. By allowing a more personal style and the projection of self into the community, it is thought that students will build a sense of trust in the community and feel more empowered to participate in the difficult work of changing their minds. Social presence supports cognitive presence by allowing the learning environment to be safe and welcoming. Teaching Presence This final element of the CoI model is the design and facilitation of the learning experience &gt;to support and enhance social and cognitive presence for the purpose of realizing educational outcomes. (p. 90). Teaching presence can be a shared function between members of the community. Garrison, et al. point out that the design of the experience is typically performed by the teacher, and the facilitation is more often shared. In a connected course like this one, there is a greater emphasis on shared facilitation in a community of learners compared to what might be experienced in a f2f (face to face) course. It is in this shared discourse in a safe environment that allows learners to engage in the difficult cognitive work of learning.

Least? - Which presence is most important for you? Note that this is an ungraded activity, but is designed to help prepare you for the assessments in this course. Throughout the course you are encouraged to take notes in a journal of some sort. Refer to these notes as you complete your assessments. 2.2 Modes of Interaction For this next topic we will look at what we mean by ‘interaction’, a word which is thrown around a lot in educational technology, but… Watch Before we get into the the topic of interaction, please take a few minutes to answer the following questions about scenarios that may or may not be considered ‘interaction’. (Note that you can check your answer right away, and then click the arrow for the next example.) What do you think? Do you agree with the ‘correct’ and ‘incorrect’ responses on the quiz? Interaction Anderson (2003) argues that, despite the lack of clarity around definitions of interaction, there seems to be a general understanding that interaction of some sort is a requirement for learning. He settles on the definition from Wagner (1994, p.8) reciprocal events that require at least two objects and two actions. Interactions occur when these objects and events mutually influence one another. He provides a model of interaction in learning environments that includes three main agents in the process: students, teachers, and content (Figure 1). Figure 1. Anderson’s Modes of Interaction (2003) At each point of the triangle are the agents in an educative process. The arrows between them indicate the two-way communication described by Wagner, and the recursive arrows above or below the agents are secondary forms of interaction. Other Models of Interaction Kanuka (2011) describes a modified model of interaction which presumes that all educational interactions occur in the context of some sort of content (Figure 2.). Figure 2. Kanuka’s Model of Interaction (2011) In Anderson’s model, content is an agent in the process, but in Kanuka’s model, content of some sort is assumed to be the foundation of learning environments and that interactions between and among learners and instructors happens in the context of making sense of the content. The content itself does not have agency. A combination of these two models was described by Madland (2014). Madland’s model, shown in figure 3, is a return to Anderson’s three-sided model except with the addition of peer interactions, and all interactions between agents occuring in the context of the content that is to be learned. Also added are the three sides of the model representing structured learning activities designed specifically to enhance the educative effects of the interactions. Figure 3. Madland’s Model of Interaction (2014) It is not enough to simply expect interactions between learners and instructors to be goal-oriented towards learning outcomes. Educators must design specific activities (teaching presence) to create the conditions (social presence) for learning to occur (cognitive presence). An example of this can be seen in the seemingly ubiquitous ‘Group Project’ assigned in so many undergraduate courses. Sometimes, groups are allowed to form themselves, other times, the instructor assigns groups, or there is some sort of random process to create groups. However they are formed, groups too often fall into a pattern of behaviour where one or two of the students do most of the work and the remaining group members engage in social loafing and benefit from their peers’ work. An alternative practice is to engage groups in a specific structured process of cooperation where everybody must do their work, or else the entire group suffers. An example is to have students work in peer review partners where students submit their assignments to their peer review partner who then provides feedback based on specific questions and categories of comments. When the original students receives their partner’s feedback, they may choose how to integrate the suggestions into the final assignment that they submit to their instructor. Each student is then graded on the quality of their finished assignment, the quality of the feedback that they provided, and on the rationale for how they incorporated the peer review into their own work. There are myriad structures that can be used to ensure that interactions are inclined towards producing student learning, and we will introduce you to some of those in unit 5. Learning Activity Read and Reflect Read the following article by Terry Anderson - Getting the mix right again: An updated and theoretical rationale for interaction As you read, consider what interactions you have experiences in online or f2f courses. 2.3 Interaction Equivalency Theorem For our last topic of this unit, we’ll explore Anderson’s (2003) Interaction Equivalency Theorem, stated as Deep and meaningful formal learning is supported as long as one of the three forms of interaction (student–teacher; student-student; student-content) is at a high level. The other two may be offered at minimal levels, or even eliminated, without degrading the educational experience. High levels of more than one of these three modes will likely provide a more satisfying educational experience, though these experiences may not be as cost or time effective as less interactive learning sequences. (p. 4) At TWU, there has always been a significant emphasis placed on student-teacher interactions. This can be seen in small class sizes and opportunities for students to be involved in faculty-led research projects and travel studies. Distance education, however, has long suffered from a distinct lack of student-teacher and student-student interactions. For many years, distance education was delivered either through the post or through one-way media such as radio or TV, virtually eliminating interactions. This led to a pervasive view that distance education courses and programs were second-rate at best. However, now that modern communication infrastructure has developed to the point that media-rich, synchronous, two-way communication is almost free, opportunities for distance learning environments to include high levels of student-student and student-teacher interaction are much more feasible. One problem remains, though, and that is that student-teacher interaction is a scarce commodity. It is costly to hire enough faculty to enable one-on-one or small-group interaction between students and faculty. The distance educator’s response to this challenge is to front-load the faculty input (high-level disciplinary expertise or cognitive presence) into the course materials and to de-couple ‘interaction’ from both time and place. In an asynchronous, text-based environment, students and teachers do not need to be present in the same place at the same time in order to enjoy rich interactions.

A facilitator is expert on process and group interactions. In education, facilitation is rooted in understanding the nature of the social learning process and how to guide its direction and quality. As a social species, we learn a great deal from each other in both formal and informal contexts. Our earliest learning experiences are profoundly social and intimate interactions between mother and child, and the social aspect of learning never ceases to be important. During this unit, we will examine a short history of social theories of learning from John Dewey and Lev Vygotsky, then, we will experiment with the theory and practices of facilitating learning in group settings. Topics This unit is divided into the following topics: Social Theories of Learning Cooperative Learning Facilitating Transformational Learning in Group Settings Navigating Group Dynamics Core Facilitation Competencies Strategies for Learning Facilitation Learning Outcomes When you have completed this unit, you should be able to: Explain how to design learning environments to maximize learning Plan appropriate group learning processes to support transformative learning. Demonstrate how to facilitate a course of study. Design cooperative activities to maximize student-student and student-content interactions Apply knowledge of the Community of Inquiry model and liberating structures to the facilitation of cooperative learning activities Identify and explain core competencies for facilitating learning. Resources Online resources will be provided in the unit. 3.1 Social Theories of Learning The idea that learning is a social process can be traced way back in time, but formal descriptions of social constructivism, as it has been called, are often traced to John Dewey, Jean Piaget, and Lev Vygotsky. Albert Bandura also contributed via social learning theory. What is social constructivism? Vygotsky (1978) argues that “every function in the child’s cultural development appears twice: first, on the social level, and later on the individual level; first between people (interpsychologically), and then inside the child (intrapsychologically) (p. 57). That is, humans learn first through social observations and interactions, which they later internalize as their own thinking. The significance of Vygotsky’s insight is that, “instead of focusing on the study of psychological entities such as skills, concepts, information-processing units, reflexes, or mental functions, it assumes that we must begin with a unit of activity” (Wertsch, 1985). This idea of activity, or to be more precise the active participation of the learner, is central to our emerging understanding of learning as a process of socially constructing knowledge. Central to this progress is language, which we first learn in the context of social interactions, then, we adopt as self-talk for self-direction and self-regulation, and ultimately internalized as our own inner speech (Vygotsky &amp; Kozulin, 1986, p. 228). Similarly, Bandura (1977) argues social role modeling is central to how most behaviors are learned, “from observing others one forms an idea of how new behaviors are performed, and on later occasions this coded information serves as a guide for action”. In sum, we may conclude that knowledge is constructed first socially, then, personally, by learners as they encounter new information, compare it to old models that they may have, and develop new understandings of how the world works. It is not the case that new knowledge is simply copied intact from one mind to another, rather new information is integrated into old understandings, bringing about a hybrid of the two. This is essentially what we understand as a constructivist model of learning. Zone of Proximal Development Social constructivism builds on the constructivist model, adding the idea that this process of integrating new understandings with old understandings is best understood as a social process. Vygotsky (1978) introduced the idea that people with a greater capacity to understand the world and cope with its challenges act as supportive structures, which enable others to construct and internalize the knowledge these people have. This new construction occurs within what Vygotsky refers to as an individual’s zone of proximal development, which he differentiated from their zone of actual development. The ZPD is the ‘sweet spot’ in education where a student is optimally challenged to learn. If the task is too easy for the student, and they have already mastered it, then learning activities will not result in learning. Conversely, if a task is so difficult that the student cannot complete it, even with assistance, learning activities will not result in learning. In the middle are tasks that a student is able to complete, but only with the assistance of a more capable peer or expert. This is the Zone of Proximal Development: Zone of Proximal Development Scaffolding A metaphor that has been used to describe one such supportive mechanism is scaffolding. A scaffold is a way for educators to support the construction of new knowledge, beginning from a person’s existing repertoire of knowledge and then preceding into new heights of understanding. The scaffold is the environment an educator creates, the support of learning facilitation, and the processes and language that are lent to the learner in the context of approaching an adaptive task and developing new abilities to meet it (Wilhelm, Baker, &amp; Dube, 2001). Furthermore, scaffolding implies not only a person’s specific relation to the modeled behavior of others; it implies a person’s relation to social communities, and “it implies becoming a full participant, a member, a kind of person” (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1996). The task of facilitating learning with the ZPD in mind assumes that you, as the facilitator, know what knowledge and skills your students are starting with. It is likely that the competencies your students display fall along a bell curve. While most students will be learning within a similar ZPD, there will be outliers at both ends of the curve. One strategy can be to pair students whose skills and knowledge are below the curve with those above the curve. In doing this, students who are above the curve, who may not be challenged with the content or skill, have to engage in greater levels of cognitive complexity in order to concisely explain to their peer and help them to meet the objective. For example, Madland and Richards (2016) describes a cooperative peer review activity, where the authors asked a group of learners how they thought cooperative learning activities supported learning. In this study, the learners’ responses indicated that the two most important factors were social cohesion and developmentally appropriate challenges, indicating that learners recognized the importance of the ZPD in learning. Learning Activity Questions to Consider After reading the topic above, consider the following question: - How does the idea of the zone of proximal development help you support learning? 3.2 Cooperative Learning Cooperative learning is a set of learning facilitation strategies that are focused on encouraging educative social interactions between learners. It is important to not conflate cooperative learning with group projects as you might remember them from your previous experiences as a university student. Group projects are often assigned because faculty seem to have a sense that working together is a good thing for students, along with a vague sense that modern jobs all require teamwork. Too often, they amount to repurposing an individual assignment (such as, a research paper) into the same task, but with multiple people handing in one item instead of three to four. When these tasks are not well structured, the process becomes problematic. Group Projects We have all likely experienced less-than-ideal group projects where one or two people do most of the work, one member is seemingly absent altogether, and another’s work is of poor quality. This is not the kind of learning activity that inspires highly engaged learners. Contrary to this dysfunctional group learning model, cooperative learning is structured in a way that maximizes effort from all students and, ideally, leads to all group members attaining high-level learning outcomes. In order to ensure this, there are five characteristics of learning groups that must be present for cooperative learning to occur: “positive interdependence, individual accountability, promotive interactions, appropriate use of social skills, and group processing” (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2009, p. 366). More about cooperative learning… Positive Interdependence Positive interdependence, according to Johnson and Johnson is the idea that individuals in a learning environment are dependent upon each other for success. In other words, I cannot succeed unless you succeed and you cannot succeed unless I succeed. So, collectively, we are interdependent. Positive interdependence is the key that distinguishes cooperative learning from competitive learning, where students are graded on a curve and only the top 2-3% of students can earn ‘A’ grades. Individual and Group Accountability In cooperative learning environments, each individual in the group is held accountable for their contributions to the final product, and feedback is provided to both the individual and the group. This helps to ensure that students who need more assistance are identified and can be supported as needed, and it also prevents the ‘social loafing’ that is common in typical ‘group projects.’ Promotive Interaction Promotive interaction is the logistics of working and learning together as a cooperative group. The essence is that group members each need to work to promote the learning of each other member of the group. Since each person will be held accountable for their work and the entire group will only succeed if each member succeeds, there is a natural social pressure on more experienced members of the group to assist those with less experience or knowledge. Interpersonal Skills Not only do members of the group need to learn the content of the lesson or project, but they must also learn the process of working well as a cooperative group. Sometimes, these processes need to be taught directly, other times (like in graduate studies) it is reasonable to presume that group members will already possess and be willing to utilize effective social skills. Group Processing Finally, the group must be able to monitor their process with the goal of improving their work process and product. This metacognitive task is crucial to the long-term improvement and progress towards learning goals. Cooperative Learning (Slavin, 2011) Learning Activity Questions to Consider After reading through the content in Topic 2, please consider the following questions: - How can coaching concepts be applied to helping learners learn? - What key characteristics define effective coaching for learning? - How can educators coach learners through the transition of making a change? 3.3 Facilitating Transformational Learning in Group Environments In Unit One, we examined the CoI model and identified how teaching presence helps to support both the cognitive and social presences within the educational experience of a course of study. An important idea we emphasized was that teaching presence can be a shared function between members of the learning community and that facilitation of the learning process is often shared (Garrison, et al., 2010). Now, we are interested in examining what a division of the teaching presence might look like if we professionalize the function of learning facilitation within a distributed model of teaching presence. Our prototype for exploring this model is TWU’s own Facilitated Academic Resource (FAR) centre. The facilitation of courses in the TWU FAR Centre model is unique, as you know. From the perspective of a traditional, campus-based faculty member in Langley, a FAR Centre course is an online course. The faculty member has worked in the role subject matter expert with an instructional designer to structure a course which integrates everything required to create an online community of inquiry with allowances for all three presences: social, cognitive, and teaching. The courses are deployed through online technology and materials are accessed digitally in remote locations. Furthermore, students submit their work to the faculty member who then assesses their work and provides both formative and summative feedback as appropriate. From the perspective of the remote student, however, the course is much more like a typical F2F course where they are meeting with a group of their fellow students in regularly scheduled learning labs in a central location and are guided through the learning materials by an experienced facilitator. The rationale for this model is that international students often experience difficulties completing online courses from Western universities, so TWU is providing a F2F Academic Facilitator to support remote students in their individual and group studies through the courses. You, as the Academic Facilitation Specialist, are a critical component of this model. Your skills in coaching facilitating student learning through courses where you may not be a subject matter expert are going to be extremely important. As such, you will need to start thinking about how to facilitate your students’ experience of a course of study’s learning activities without the immediate F2F presence of a faculty member. In the activity below, you will read about the concept and practices of facilitating transformation learning. Facilitating Group Learning Sessions The work of facilitating the learning process within a group setting begins with an effective plan. Smith (2009) proposes a simple model: EFFECT. This model reminds the facilitator to think about the learning environment, the focus (or purpose) of the session, feelings the session is likely to evoke, experiences learners will explore, changes learners will make as a result of the session, and the timings allocated for all the learning experiences and activities. Next, it’s important for the facilitator to plan out the structure of each learning session, which like a story, should have beginnings, middles, and endings. Each stage has a particular task. The beginning encourages learners to explore, the middle engages learners with the subject, and the ending enables learners to move on in their personal learning journey. Drawing upon Evans’ (2007) guidelines for helping conversations, Smith (2009) advises facilitators to think about “the exploration as the first quarter of the session; engaging with the subject and developing understanding as the middle half; and enabling action and development as the final quarter.” Learning Activity Read the following article: Facilitating Learning and Change in Groups Questions to Consider After completing the reading above, consider the following questions: - According to Roger Schwarz what is a facilitator’s main task? - According to Carl Rogers what are the core conditions for facilitating learning? - What are the three foci of the facilitator role? - What are the core values informing facilitation? - How can the EFFECT model help you to plan a facilitated learning session? - How does a facilitator effectively structure a facilitated learning session? 3.4 Navigating Group Dynamics In this Unit we have examined how individual learning may be understood as a social process, however, it is also important for facilitators to understand that the group as a whole also learns and develops. Forsyth (2017) defines a social group as “two or more individuals who are connected to one another by and within social relationship” (p. 3). The number of group members, the presence of links between members, and the nature of those links all shape the group and the quality of learning it supports. An essential requirement for learning in a group is a sufficient level of cohesion and trust between members. Some of the group characteristics that tend to cultivate trust within a group include: Similarity - The more similar members are in terms of age, sex, education, skills, attitudes, values, and beliefs, the more likely the group will bond. Stability - The longer a group stays together, the more cohesive it becomes. Size - Smaller groups tend to have higher cohesion. Support - Coaching and encouragement to support other members strengthens the group’s identity. Satisfaction - How pleased group members are with each other’s performance, behaviour, and conformity to group norms increases cohesion. One factor that tends to erode trust within a group is: Social Loafing - There is a tendency of individuals to put in less effort when working in a group context. As group size grows, this effect becomes larger. Group Development It is important for facilitators to understand that groups change over time. One of the most influential and helpful models of group development was articulated by Bruce W. Tuckman (1965). His research finding was that groups typically move through five critical stages of development: Forming: Members get to know one another, exchange personal information, and establish new relationships. Storming: Members open up to each other and confront each other’s ideas and perspectives. Norming: Members achieve a consensus about goals, definition of roles, and clear coordination of effort. Performing: The group is able to function as a unit as they find ways to get the job done smoothly and effectively without inappropriate conflict or the need for external facilitation. Adjourning: At some point the group ends. ✨ ProTip Each stage of group development requires the facilitator to employ variations in their approach. Transforming (Me to We) Development Phase Facilitation Approach Forming (Unwilling and unable) Clear goals, directions, fairness, firmness. (Why? Overcoming denial of the new reality.) Storming (Willing and unable) As above, plus encouraging participation, calmness, recognition of concerns. (Why? Overcoming defence of the old reality.) Norming (Unwilling and able) Encouraging, confidence building, clear goals, holding accountable) (Why? Helping discard the old reality.) Performing (Willing and able) Clear goal setting, monitoring, sptrategic preparation, seeking innovative approaches, empowering team members. (Why? Helping make new adaptations.) Reforming (Disengaging) Establishing new goals, solving confusion, managing risks. (Why? Challenging the new comfort zone.) Learning Activity Take a moment to read the following article: What is a Group? Questions to Consider After reading the article above, consider the following questions: - What are some of the key benefits and dangers of learning in group settings? - What are some key dimensions of groups? - What are the stages of group development? Learning Activity Take a moment to read the following article: Comfort Zone to Performance Management Questions to Consider After completing the reading above, consider the following questions: - How is White’s Optimal Performance Zone similar Vygotsky’s ZPD? - How does White’s model help a facilitator determine how to adjust their facilitation strategies? - What insight does White’s model provide about how to sustain learning performance? 3.5 Core Facilitation Competencies The professionalization of learning facilitation within educational settings is a promising, but new development. The core competencies are still emerging, as institutions begin to prototype this model. Below is a tentative list of competencies we have identified through in our preliminary experiments. Develop multi-session study plans for completing courses Select clear study methods and learning activities Prepare time and space to support group learning Create and sustain a participatory transformative learning environment Guide Group to meet each course learning outcome Directing processes for sharing peer feedback (in self-directed learning) Providing learners with formative feedback Mediating exchange of coursework and feedback between students &amp; instructor Learning Activity Take some time to read the following article: Core Competencies Questions to Consider After completing the reading above, consider the following questions: - What general facilitation competencies apply to facilitating learning? - What competencies do you feel are strength areas? What areas do you need to develop? - How can facilitation skills help you support learner success in an educational setting? 3.6 Facilitation Strategies Strategies for facilitating learning are as numerous and varied as the educators who create them. In the FAR model of professionally facilitated learning we are proposing in this course, each FAR course you may help facilitate in the future has a facilitator’s guide that provides designs for each learning activity. While these designs provide you with the majority of the learning facilitation strategies required in a given course, the needs of learners are not always predictable and emergent strategies may be needed. Liberating Structures It can often be challenging to devise new ways of interacting in F2F learning environments, but there are many resources available to facilitators both online and in print. One of those resources is a book and website called Liberating Structures which describes a set of 33 structured activities that you can use in your learning labs to generate conversation without resorting to the same old tired ‘brainstorm.’ Learning Activity Watch the video below for a quick introduction to Liberating Structures: Next, visit the Liberating Structures website and take a look at the following activity: What, So What, Now What? W³ Now, consider how could you use this Liberating Structure to guide a group discussion that would help learners learn a Unit? Unit 3 Assessment WordPress Post Please complete the assignment under ‘Post 3’ below. This will be your third of five draft posts during the course. Blog Post 3 Checking Your Learning Before you move on to the next unit, you may want to check to make sure that you are able to: ✅ Explain how to design learning environments to maximize learning. ✅ Plan appropriate group learning processes to support transformative learning. ✅ Demonstrate how to facilitate a course of study. ✅ Design cooperative activities to maximize student-student and student-content interactions. ✅ Apply knowledge of the Community of Inquiry model and liberating structures to the facilitation of cooperative learning activities. ✅ Identify and explain core competencies for facilitating learning.
