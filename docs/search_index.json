The intersection of adult learning, educational technology, and international education thought is investigated in relation to the development of effective strategies for coaching learners within the emerging context of technologically distributed global higher education. Projects develop digital literacy skills, including the use of communication, collaboration and publishing tools; and media literacy, including knowledge of copyright, open licensing, and digital citizenship.

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!
