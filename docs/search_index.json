This will start with you posting to a Moodle Discussion forum, and then transition to your blog (to be introduced in Unit 3). You should consider your posts as a place for you to try out new ideas, to test your assumptions, and to share what you are learning with your community. At the end of the course you will produce a Showcase Post, which will represent your best work. The showcase post will be the only graded post; however, your final grade will also consider how your ideas developed over the process of you writing five working draft posts. Each of your draft posts should be 400-500 words. Post 1 Due at the end of Unit 1 Topic In a new post, complete the Visitors and Residents in online spaces Learning Activity. What do you notice about your map? What do you wonder? To submit all of your posts for the course, create a new post on your own WordPress blog and use the category ldrs663. Post 2 Due at the end of Unit 2 Read and Discuss Review Getting the mix right again: An updated and theoretical rationale for interaction by Terry Anderson. Read Interaction and the online distance classroom: Do instructional methods effect the quality of interaction? by Heather Kanuka. Then, post a reponse on your blog defending or criticizing Anderson’s Interaction Equivalency Theorem. Ensure that you defend or criticize the idea, not the person, and include something that you have learned about interaction from somewhere other than the assigned readings. If your birthday is between January 1 and June 30, defend Anderson’s Interaction Equivalency Theorem. If your birthday is between July 1 and December 31, criticize Anderson’s Interaction Equivalency Theorem Feel free to respond to arguments presented by your colleagues for or against the theorem.

Post 5 Due at the end of Unit 5 Topic Throughout this unit we have explore the idea of the educational experience. Your task for the Unit 5 Blog Post, is to reflect on recent trends in higher, and other forms, of adult education in terms of the multitude of new ways institutions are offering access educational experiences. You can use the following questions to guide your writing: How can educational institutions give learners more control over their learning experiences? What benefits and challenges does learner-centred access to education introduce? Is the recent move towards multi-access education shifting the site of education back to an emphasis on study and away from the focus on instruction that dominated the modern era? How might this shift change the educator’s role and responsibilities? How might this shift change the learner’s role and responsibilities change? How can institutions ensure quality and transformational learning outcomes? Showcase Post Due at the end of the course Topic Choose one of the previous 5 posts that you would like to showcase as your best work. Take some time to polish and expand your post (aim for 600-700 words). Ways to expand your post might include: - finding more published research about the topic to integrate into your post; - writing about how your views have changed on the topic during the course; - writing a counter-argument refuting your previous post. Please include citations (links) and a reference list at the end of your post. To submit this discussion post, create a new post on your own WordPress blog and use the categories ‘ldrs663’ and ‘showcase’. Facilitated Curriculum Analysis (10%) Working together as a learning pod, examine a curricular resource that is, or could be, used with a facilitated learning approach. Emphasis will be placed on courses in higher education, including a selection of TWU’s library of FAR courses (specifically designed to be delivered in a facilitated learning approach). However, a range of other formats are open for investigation, including (but not limited to) community-based programs, professional certification programs, corporate workshops or training programs, and masterclasses. Your pod will be invited to select a specific course of study and asked to assess the curriculum from a facilitation and coaching perspective. To begin, follow the steps below: Step 1 Review the course materials you have been assigned or received approve to analyze. Step 2 Write a Summary of Understanding. In this second step you will critically reflect on the course materials and write a 3-page summary of understanding from your perspective as a future learning facilitator who is preparing to facilitate this course. In your summary you will compose in your own words your thought on the following: Who is the course for? Describe the target learners to whom the course will be offered. The instructors and/or your sponsor organization will provide you with this information. But, you should also add some of your own research. How has COVID-19 impacted the learners in the course? Learners and faculty alike have been deeply impacted by coronavirus and COVID-19. How has that impacted learners in the course? Are they quarantined? Do they have access to technology at home? A quiet place to study? Are they looking after their children during the course? What is the course about? Consider the course title, description, course learning outcomes, unit and topic titles, and in your own words try to summarize how you would explain to someone what this course of study is about? What do learners need to know? Looking for patterns in the course materials and try to identify what you think are the three to five big ideas that the learners are expected to learn in this course? What do learners need to do? Look at the learning activities and assessments to identify the performance-based tasks learners need to do. Specifically, focus on the tasks like forum posts and papers the learners need to produce something. How do the learners complete the course? Determine if there is a critical path of task throughout the course. That is, are certain tasks contingent on one task being completed for another one can be done? Or is the path open-ended? What challenges do you anticipate? Identify the specific challenges that you think learners may face as they work through this particular course of study. Do parts of the course look particularly difficult? Are any resources missing, or underdeveloped, or potentially difficult for certain cultural contexts to understand? What supports do you need to prepare? Identify the specific types of support you anticipate will be critical to helping learners successfully complete the learning outcomes of the course you are analyzing. What questions do you have? If you could ask the course designer clarifying questions about the course, what would you want to know? What is unclear? What don’t you understand? What are you curious to know more about? Grading Rubric for Curriculum Facilitation Analysis Emerging (0-69%) No/Minimal demonstration of independent thought, insight, and creativity (applies course concepts, raises questions, recognises competing perspectives, and evaluates implications) No/minimal evidence of having reviewed all readings and a lack of comprehensiveness in responses to questions. No/Minimal demonstration of ability to communicate ideas in writing and to organize responses clearly, thoroughly, and concisely. ### Developing (70-89%) Sufficient demonstration of independent thought, insight, and creativity (applies course concepts, raises questions, recognises competing perspectives, and evaluates implications) Evidence of having reviewed all readings (course related and the curriculum resources being assessed) and a comprehensiveness in responses to questions. Demonstrates ability to communicate ideas in writing and to organize responses clearly, thoroughly, and concisely. ### Mastering (90-100%) Clearly demonstrates independent thought, insight, and creativity (applies course concepts, raises questions, recognises competing perspectives, and evaluates implications) Presence of examples and evidence of understanding of content create a comprehensive response that is accurate and thorough. Organization and use of language is concise and clearly articulates ideas with no confusion. To submit this assignment, scroll to the bottom of the screen on the Unit 5 Tab and select the “Unit 5 - Curriculum Facilitation Analysis Assignment” dropbox. Facilitation Resource Project (40%) Working as a learning pod, you will create a guide to serve as a resource for you and others to facilitate a particular course of study. We can’t emphasize enough how important it will be for you to have analyzed, critiqued, and integrated into your practice the model of coaching and facilitation in real-world settings. As you may be facilitating learning experiences in subjects where you may not have significant domain knowledge, it will be critical for you to be able to lead students through thinking and learning processes that will lead to them discovering what they need to know from the expertly prepared course materials in order to help solve their questions. Learning Pods At the beginning of the course everyone will be placed into small groups called learning pods. these groups, of about four people, will be the place where you will practice learning facilitation and coaching principles and skills that you are learning in this course. The pods will also form the working group for doing a curriculum analysis and developing a facilitated learning resource. Peer Coaching Session (15%) Working with another student (in your pod), you will each coach each other through the process of writing your final “showcase” post as part of your learning reflection blog assignment. You will record a video of your session and write critical reflection on your actions as the learning coach. "],["building-the-web.html", "Unit 1 Building the Web Overview Topics Outcomes Resources 1.1 Visitors and Residents 1.2 FIPPA, Privacy, and Consent Resources 1.3 WordPress and Privacy 1.4 WordPress Setup 1.5 WordPress Tutorials", " Unit 1 Building the Web Overview Over the first two weeks, we will introduce you to some background thinking about educational technologies. There are countless companies vying for attention in the edtech field, and they are not all educationally beneficial. In fact, some are outright harmful. We believe that it is important for you to begin to think about how your data are used when you interact with edtech tools and that it is important for you to develop some skills and competencies in building your own domain on the web. With this knowledge, you will be more prepared to spot the nefarious actors and to take control of how you present yourself online. Topics Situating yourself online Data and Privacy Subverting surveilance capitalism Outcomes you will be able to articulate the importance of data and your privacy rights you will have gained confidence in presenting your whole self online you will be able to create and manage a single WordPress blog. Resources Online resources will be provided. 1.1 Visitors and Residents It is likely that you have encountered and may believe that there is a distinction between digital ‘natives’ and ‘immigrants’. Note Marc Prensky, who proposed this idea, is the one who thought it would be a good idea to refer to people as ‘natives’. We recognize that this term should not be used to talk about people. The essential argument is that kids these days have changed in that they have this innate ability to use and learn technology because they have grown up using technology, and those of us whose formative years pre-date the advent of the internet are forever at a disadvantage compared to the kids. You can read a bit more about the idea on Wikipedia, linked below. There is also a link in that article to Prensky’s original article. Digital native Aside from the problematic framing of learners as kids, there are some distinct challenges with the idea of digital literacy being a fixed trait rather than a matter of comfort, familiarity, and a skill that can be practiced and learned. It is no secret that more young people are comfortable using social media apps like TikTok, Instagram, SnapChat, Weibo, WeChat, and the like, but that does not mean that those people are more able to learn technology than older people or that they have an innate ability to do so. Have you ever asked a 1st-year university student to use a spreadsheet to create a budget or a gradebook with embedded formulae? It is more likely than not, that you will encounter a distinct lack of skill in completing this task. I’d like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a visitor in some web spaces and a resident in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you, quite literally, visit, but importantly, don’t leave a public trace of your time there. You don’t spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving. Alternately, there are places and spaces on the web, where you reside as a persona, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or Twitter, or maybe it’s a listserv you subscribed to back in the 90s, or your blog, or someone else’s blog or social site. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people; where you are socially present. At the same time, if we can imagine the visitor &lt;–&gt; resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal &lt;–&gt; professional (or educational) continuum on a vertical axis, leading to 4 quadrants where you might situate your technology use. The video below explains a process to help you think about where you reside on the web (7 mins). Link to YouTube I’ve shared my VR Diagram below…keep in mind that this diagram represents a set of tools that I have been using for a decade or more and that I have invested my career in educational technology. There is a lot here, but yours might look significantly different with only a few tools here and there. The main thing I would like to communicate with this idea of visitors and residents is for you to think about which technologies you use as a resident, and then to think about where your learners reside on the web. From there, we can begin to plan for tools we can use that afford us and our learners the opportunity to reside there. Visitor-Resident Diagram It is certainly notable that I am very much a visitor in Moodle! This does not mean that I don’t spend much time there, I spend a significant portion of every day working in Moodle, rather, the work that I do there leaves very little trace of my personality. You will (hopefully) see Moodle as much more of a place where you reside. But this foregrounds the question of whether Moodle is actually designed to promote residencies. Certainly the forums allow for users to project their persona into the system, as do a few of the other features, but the system itself is very heavily templated. There are profiles that can be edited, but users are limited to one very tiny image and virtually no opportunity to determine for themselves what they want to share. There is little room for customization, and every time a course ends, every single user must recreate their persona in a new course site (or five). For many, or most, of you, Moodle is a perfectly reasonable place to reside and you are able to make learners feel at home there. We encourage that. And just like our physical homes, the quality of the community that lives there isn’t determined by the features of the house itself, but by the people who share the space and how they structure their time and interactions. If you don’t already, I encourage you to subscribe to this excellent podcast called Teaching in Higher Ed by Bonni Stachowiak, or, just take 47 minutes to listen to this episode in which Bonni interviews Dave White about the idea of visitors and residents. Digital Visitors and Residents, with David White - Teaching in Higher Ed One of the people I look up to as an educator published a blog post which I believe provides a fitting summary of this particular unit. Technology is not Pedagogy Learning Activity Visitor and Resident Diagram I hope this activity will help you think about how the tools we use shape and sometimes determine the nature of our interactions with learners. Do the tools you use fall on the visitor or the resident end of your continuum? What about the learners in your classes? ✔️ Read Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement ✔️ Complete your own Visitor/Resident map and share and discuss it with your Learning Pod. You can use the tool that is provided here (DON’T forget to screenshot it, or you’ll lose it!), or use a different tool like Canva.com. ✔️ Share your Visitor-Resident Diagram in a new post on your WordPress blog. Include a short reflection on what your diagram tells you about your web presence. Feel free to interact with others’ diagrams! 1.2 FIPPA, Privacy, and Consent Resources It is second nature to most to take selfies and share them on Instagram, Snapchat, etc., but once you move into the role of an educator in either a public or private context, you must adhere to the laws set out by the B.C. Office of Information and Privacy Commissioner. Their office has put together guidelines for both public bodies and private bodies. TWU, as a private body is not held to the same standard as public bodies, but we should strive to meet the same standard. The guidelines for public bodies to better understand what the rules are is linked below and how to get consent is detailed on page 4 of the BC Cloud Computing Guidelines (PDF) and you can review the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act here.. TWU also has a privacy policy, available here. Each public body will have their own process (which may range from not allowing tools to pressure to integrate networked learning tools from outside of Canada), so it is important to understand your own setting and the law. You may find some administrators or staff breaking these rules or not aware of them. It is important for you to enter your field and uphold the law, regardless of the culture you enter. This does not mean that you do not engage online or outside of Canada. It means that if/when you do so, that you understand the steps, which are not much more complex than the consent you would get normally for going “on the Internet,” as is described in most settings, but you must name the date consent is effective and, if applicable, the date it expires. It is important that you work with your school district on the consent process. You can see an example of how K-12 school districts are addressing access to cloud tools outside of Canada here (Coquitlam) and here plus here (Victoria). You must also name each tool individually. It cannot be “blogging.” You must name WordPress.com or Blogger, etc. If you use Flipgrid, you must name Flipgrid. Consent must also be informed, so effort must be taken to ensure that those signing consent understand the implications – that their data may leave Canada, how it may be harvested, and to know about the U.S. Patriot Act. One archived resource by the Canadian Treasury Board provides significant detailed information about the Patriot Act here. It is helpful to also review section 4(b) of the B.C. Digital Literacy Framework which is applicable K12 contexts but helpful for others. Additional resources can be found here: Privacy, Ethics &amp; Security in Digital Spaces Developing Awareness of Privacy Information Security Awareness by the BC Government MediaSmarts: Canada’s Centre for Digital and Media Literacy FIPPA, Privacy, and Consent Competencies Learners should ensure that they: - Are aware of the OIPC, FIPPA, and the Cloud Computing Guidelines and follow them - Understand what constitutes personal information - Understand that privacy online is a personal choice and must be respected - Understand that when you assume an “educator” hat, you have a duty for those under your care, their parents and families, and your colleagues with regard to their privacy and protection of personal information - Are aware that the Canadian federal government states that the chances are remote that the US Patriot Act will access personal information of Canadians, but recognizes that it is our responsibility to protect privacy preferences and to ensure that consent obtained is informed consent. Some families may be involved with restraining orders and need to be private for their safety, but the reasons for privacy may be preference. Either way, it is not our business as to the reasons for privacy preferences, but it is our responsibility to uphold preferences. - Understand how media moves through networks into US cloud-based services (e.g., back-ups on iTunes, syncing with Dropbox, messages with personal information is sent on Gmail, Google Docs, blog RSS subscriptions, etc.) - Understand that these acts do not prohibit participation in networked tools outside of Canada and many public bodies are in need of staff and leaders who model networked literacy and positive citizenship online for their community - Understand what appropriate consent looks like for public bodies and is aware of what alternative steps are to support learners when consent is not obtained. 1.3 WordPress and Privacy Now that you have thought about privacy in our digital world, it is time for you to make some decisions about how you would like to ‘be’ online. You are invited to document your learning in WordPress. This means that your work would be posted online on a public site. Keep in mind, though, that you are NOT required to post your work publicly. The steps below can help you decide how comfortable you are with sharing publicly. Please review all 5 steps below to decide on your approach. Decide if you are comfortable posting your work online. If not, you can document your learning offline (with technology) by changing the privacy settings on your blog or using Word documents and offline video. We would ask learners to consider using an online blogging tool with no identification/using a pseudonym, so as to develop network literacy, which is important in supporting learners, who are growing up in networked environments, but the preferences of learners will be respected and supported. If you are comfortable being online, then proceed to step 2. Would you like to use your real name or use a pseudonym? You can claim your name online and own your presence by using your full name. With increasing catfishing and identity theft online, it can be helpful to have a presence that may compete with any fake profiles of you that are out there or to have a more dominant presence so posts or pictures of you by others may get drowned out. That said, you may wish to create an identity without your personal information (e.g., West coast teacher). The choice is yours. With that decision made, proceed to step 3. Decide if you would like your blog to be hosted outside of Canada or inside of Canada. We strongly recommend that you create a blog at create.twu.ca which is built specifically for students and faculty at TWU, is hosted within Canada, and is completely free for you to use. We also have created a template for you there, which will make getting started easier. You will not lose access to your site at create.twu.ca after you finish at TWU, but you are free to export it and publish it on your own space and on your own domain (e.g., http://yourname.ca or http://westcoastteacher.ca) with a web hosting company for a reasonable annual fee. Some of these companies host outside of Canada (e.g., Dreamhost), while others host within Canada (e.g., Canadian Web Hosting). Be sure you review the resources under the privacy tutorial on this site or talk to your instructor about the implications of your options. You should also review the resources at the BC Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner along with the Cloud Computing Guidelines, which outline how to get consent. With that decision made, proceed to step 4. You also have to decide if you want to make your blog public or private. You can set an entire blog to be private or simply selected posts can be set to private. You can set a password or invite people to gain access. We have provided instructions for adjusting your privacy settings on the tutorial page for opened.ca. ✨ ProTip If you choose to make your blog private, we will not be able to syndicate your posts to the course site. You will still be able to participate in the course, but please contact your instructor if you choose to make your site only visible to registered users of the network or your site. And last, but not least… Finally, you have to think about where you and your content will end up. The wonderful thing about WordPress is that you can import that exported file into another WordPress instance (it sounds hard, but it isn’t and we’ll show you) or if you want to later set up your own domain and with your own WordPress installation. You may also import it into WordPress.com, but be aware that if you made posts with personal information knowing your site was hosted in Canada at the time and simply contained regular consent, without the specific consent for hosting outside of Canada, which requires you to name each tool, etc., you might not have consent to switch to WordPress.com. We often advise learners to post as if they will be on the cloud outside of Canada. To be honest, if you have a public blog, your friends and colleagues may be using U.S. cloud-hosted tools like Feedly to curate and read your blog posts or they may repost/quote your content on their U.S. blog. There are many educators who use U.S. software in their teaching and to support their learners. Just be sure to review how to get consent as per page four of the BC OIPC Cloud Computing Guidelines linked here. Creating a Blog Once you have done all the reflections on these 5 steps, you can move forward with creating a blog.
