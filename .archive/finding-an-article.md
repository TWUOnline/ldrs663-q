Ok...it would seem that the TWU library has lost access to the database that contains the Kanuka article above ('Interaction and the online distance classroom...'). Here is how I go about tracking down articles In this case, I've completed all of the checked items and am waiting to hear back from Dr. Kanuka):

✅ I see if I have access through another library. As a PhD candidate at UVic, I have access to their library, and it turns out that this article is in their collection, but that doesn't help you.  
✅ I use a Firefox extension called 'Unpaywall', which searches for open-access versions of the same articleas researchers are often able to post pre-print versions of their article on their own site. In this case, unpaywall just links to the PDF that I have access to through UVic.  
✅ I contact the [TWU library](https://libguides.twu.ca/help){target="_blank"} for assistance, as librarians are among the most helpful people on the planet. In this case, I was provided an open link, but that link looks fishy as it isn't apparently tied to Kanuka's site, but rather an aggregation site. Often, I also request an inter-library loan, in which the TWU library would contact another library (maybe UVic) and request a copy through them.  
✅ Search [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com){target="_blank"} as that will often pick up on preprints on the author's website.  
✅ Search [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/){target="_blank"} for preprints.  
✅ Contact the author of the paper. They often have permission to share preprints (see above) and are usually happy to share their work, especially with grad students.  
❌ Here is where we start getting into academic grey areas...so don't do this. It is against publishers policy to use tools like the hashtag #ICanHazPDF on Twitter, where you post the title of the article you are looking for under that hashtag and another researcher might respond by DM'ing you a copy. You shouldn't do this, because it cuts into the ***absurd*** profits of massive multi-national corporations who benefit from the free work of researchers all over the world. This is nothing like walking down a hallway and knocking on your colleague's door to ask if they have a copy of a paper, because that is super illegal too and this is digital...or something.  

And this whole mess of strategies could be avoided if everyone published under an open license and the research that is created, usually with government funding, was freely available to those who need it.

### An update on this link... {.unnumbered}
✅ I received a response from the author, who generously provided a PDF copy of the article. This is very common.  
✅ Also, I discovered at the bottom of the page when I viewed the article signed into a different library, that there was an option to get a sharing link, so I copied that link and updated the URL above. This seems to provide a read-only link for people who don't have access through a library or other institution.
