## Graduate Level Writing Standards {.unnumbered}

For students in 663, graduate level writing standards following APA 7 are expected. Please consult the [OWL Purdue website](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html){target="_blank"} for guidance and seek assistance from the TWU Writing Center and writing coaches as needed. Assignments have rubrics that attribute some marks to APA formatting and cannot be graded as fully meeting expectations if there are APA errors. That said, your conceptual understanding remains of primary importance. It is your responsibility to ensure polished work to the highest standard of which you are capable. This demands meticulous attention to detail, which will become more 'natural' with practice. Please seek any necessary clarification from your instructor.
