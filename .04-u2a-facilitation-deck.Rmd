# Facilitation Notes {-}

#### Facilitating Group Learning {-}

#### Facilitation Session {-}

Working in small groups you will facilitate a short 10-15 min learning activity. In your learning pods each select a topic from LDRS 663 and guide your group through a review discussion of that topic. After your learning activity follow-up with a short What, So What, Now What? W3 review of your facilitation sessions to give each other feedback about your facilitation. You will record a video of your session and critically reflect on your actions as the learning facilitator.

Your reflection should be submitted as 1-2-page document.

#### Two Similar, but Different "Teaching Presence" Roles {-}

- Facilitator: Guiding the coordination of a group's collaboration and managing its learning process. The focus of this role is on directly helping the group to improve its functioning in achieving a set outcome.
- Coach: Helping individual learners to take responsibility to grow as individuals and also as a learning community, increase their awareness, and establish their own individual and cooperative goals, norms, and learning processes. The focus of this role is on helping learners to learn how to learn, individually and also as a group.

#### Facilitation Competencies {-}
- Create cooperative working relationships with the group
- Determining group needs and designing group sessions
- Managing group processes
- Selecting appropriate group learning methods and learning processes
- Preparing time and space to support group learning
- Creating and sustaining a supportive and participatory group learning environment
- Demonstrating effective communication
- Insuring inclusiveness
- Managing conflict
- Encouraging creativity
- Guiding group to consensus and desired learning outcome

#### Facilitation Process {-}

#### Facilitating the Process of Prescribed Learning {-}

#### Managing Group Dynamics {-}

#### Cohesion Factors that Cultivate (Predictable) Trust {-}

- Similarity. The more similar members are in terms of age, sex, education, skills, attitudes, values, and beliefs, the more likely the group will bond.
- Stability. The longer a group stays together, the more cohesive it becomes.
- Size. Smaller groups tend to have higher cohesion.
- Support. Coaching and encouragement to support other members strengthens the group's identity.
- Satisfaction. How pleased group members are with each other's performance, behaviour, and conformity to group norms increases cohesion.

#### Social Loafing {-}

- There is a tendency of individuals to put in less effort when working in a group context.
- As group size grows, this effect becomes larger.

#### How do learning groups develop over time? {-}

![Tuckman's Stages of Group Performance](assets/presentations/facilitation/tuckman.drawio.png)

- Forming: Learning group members get to know one another, exchange personal information, and establish new relationships.
- Storming: Learning group members open up to each other and confront each other's ideas and perspectives.
- Norming: Learning group members achieve a consensus about goals, definition of roles, and clear coordination of effort.
- Performing: The learning group is able to function as a unit as they find ways to get the job done smoothly and effectively without inappropriate conflict or the need for external supervision.
- Adjourning: admittedly a strained rhyme, but the idea, which is not in Tuckman's original model, is that the group will eventually disband, and it is important to finish well, gather data on the process, and carry forward lessons learned.

|  :---:  |  ---  |
|  **Transforming** (Me to We)     |       |
|    *Forming* <br> (Unwilling/unable)   |  Clear goals, **directions**, fairness, firmness <br> (Why: overcoming denial of the new reality)     |
|  *Storming* <br> (Willing/unable)     |   As above, plus **encouraging participation**, calmness, recognition of concerns <br> (Why: overcoming defence of the old reality)    |
|  *Norming* <br> (Unwilling/able)     |  Encouraging, **confidence building**, clear goals, holding accountable <br> (Why: helping discard the old reality)     |
|   **Performing** <br> (Willing/able)    |  Clear goal setting, monitoring, strategic preparation, seeking innovative approaches, **empowering team members** <br> (Why: helping make new adaptations)     |
|  **Reforming** <br> (Disengaging)     |  **Establishing new goals**, solving confusion, managing risks <br> (Why: challenging the new comfort zone)     |

#### Managing the group learning process {-}

Working with Creative Tension in Teams

1. be clear about the results the team wants to create (vision as important as group dynamics reality);
2. understand the underlying structural dynamics that influence the team's ability to create;
3. work on changing those underlying structures in order to bring the current reality in line with the desired outcome.
