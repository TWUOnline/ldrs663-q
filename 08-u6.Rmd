# Concluding the Course

Congratulations! We have taken a bit of a whirlwind tour through the main ideas of *facilitating learning experiences* and *coaching learners through challenges*. These two competencies form the backbone of the model of teaching and learning in the TWU GLOBAL FAR Centres and similar programs, and they are also highly transferable skills for anyone who is in a role that involves the acquisition of new cognitive skills.

These two related competencies are not 'new' educational ideas, but are based in a long history of educational research showing the power of social constructivist pedagogies to transform thinking within a critical community of inquiry.
